		<h2>Jennifer Bolin, LICSW</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile-small">Counseling and Therapy</h3>
	</div>

	<p class="top-margin">
		I have a passion for helping others discover their best selves. Fears, anxieties, and difficult circumstances can leave us feeling stuck and hold us back from living the life we truly want. I love joining with my clients to explore these barriers and overcome them to create peace and wholeness. I have experience working with a broad range of concerns, including anxiety, depression, trauma, disordered eating, and LGBT issues.
	</p>

	<p>
		In my experience, therapy is the most beneficial when we engage in meaningful discussion and exploration of your thoughts, feelings, beliefs, values, and life history. I work hard to create a safe space in which there are no "taboo" topics and where authenticity and connection can grow.
	</p>

	<p>
		I generally utilize a variety of therapeutic techniques including CBT, psychodynamics, and mindfulness. I also believe that humor is an important part of growth and healing. My goal with all of my clients is to help them arrive at a place where they feel comfortable, secure, and empowered to be themselves.
	</p>

	<h3 id="office" class="top-margin">Office Locations</h3>

	<p>
		I see clients at two different office locations in Boston and Cambridge.  Both offices are easily accessible by public transportation and also have metered street parking available.

	<h3 id="insurance" class="top-margin">Insurance</h3>
	<p>
		I am an in-network provider with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts.  While I am not contracted with any other insurance companies,  I am more than happy to provide session receipts or any other needed documents to assist clients in submitting out-of-network claims on their own behalf.  
	</p>
		
	<h3 id="contact" class="top-margin">Contact</h3>
	<p>
		I can be reached at jenniferbolinlicsw@gmail.com or on my <a href="http://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_detail.php?profid=185900">Psychology Today profile</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Prior to setting up an initial session with potential new clients, I like to have a consultation over the phone to allow us to get to know each other a little better and to assess if we are likely to be a good fit for each other.  
	</p>

<h3 id="about" class="top-margin">About Me</h3>

<p>
	Each year I have been a therapist has solidified my certainty that this work is the best use of my skills and abilities as a person.  Helping others find their best selves helps me be my best self.
</p>

<p>
	I am a transplant to the Boston area; I grew up in the western US and attended graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin.  I currently live in a postage-stamp-sized apartment with my wonderful partner and our somewhat neurotic, unfailingly loving mutt Harley. 
</p>

<p>
	In my spare time I enjoy running, crocheting, reading, and spending time with my friends. I am an avid fan of NPR with particular affinity for <i>This American Life</i> and <i>Wait Wait Don't Tell Me</i>. I am typically an extrovert, but on occasion I unplug from the world with embarrassing reality TV and Pixar movies.
